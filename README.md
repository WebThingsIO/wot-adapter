# wot-adapter

This is an adapter add-on for [WebThings Gateway](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway) which enables users to discover and add W3C compliant WoT devices to their gateway.

**Note:** This adapter consumes W3C compliant [Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/)s and will eventually supercede the [thing-url-adapter](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/thing-url-adapter) which consumes [Web Thing Description](https://iot.mozilla.org/wot/#web-thing-description)s conforming to Mozilla's legacy [Web Thing API](https://iot.mozilla.org/wot) specification.
